# LeetCode
- This is my repository for all of my Leetcode problems that are programmed in C++, C#, Python and Javascript as well.

- Please feel free to view the solutions to any of my problems and provide any feedback that you think will be helpful.

- I will mainly be focusing on questions from the Blind 75 Leetcode questions list, but I will also be doing additional questions as well.

- Leetcode Problem: 904 Max_Fruits Description
- You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. 
- The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
- You want to collect as much fruit as possible.
- However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
- 1. You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- 2. Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The   ---picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- 3.  Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
- 4.  Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
